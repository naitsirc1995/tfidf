Test Project
              1.
Build an API using Python that takes a URL and returns the terms with the highest TF-IDF on the page.
To compute IDF use the articles in this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news
The url parameters are: url and limit Example call:
/tfidf?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTf-idf&limit=10
 
Example response:
{
  "terms": [
    {
      "term": "term1",
      "tf-idf": 2.5
    }, 
    ...
  ]
}
 
Please provide instructions for running the API locally and let us know how you tested it. You may use standard and open-source libraries and you may consult online materials or books.
 
	2.
No need to actually implement this, just explain how you would do it.
How would you design a system that, in addition to computing TF-IDF counts for the provided URL upon request, updates the IDF statistics whenever TF-IDF for a previously unseen URL is requested? How would you deploy this on AWS or GCP?
 
We are looking forward to hearing from you!
